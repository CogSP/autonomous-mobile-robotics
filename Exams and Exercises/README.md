# Midterm 2022-2023

- Problem 1: single-legged hopping robot
	- (a) geometry of the configuration space
	- (b) kinematic model of the robot with physical interpretation
		- aim at obtaining $\dot{\phi} = u_1$ and $\dot{l} = u_2$ since these are respectively the directly actuated revolute and prismatic joint
		- you may choose a basis for which the physical interpretation of $u_i$ is not clear. In that case you have to re-try.
	- (c) Local and Global mobility
		- Local mobility given by the fact that $\dot{q} \in \mathbb{N}(A^T(q)$
		- Global mobility must be proven with $dim(\Delta_{A}) = n
  			- Note that you just have to find 3 linearly independent vector to prove it, no need to go further since the matrix is $3 \times 3$ and so all the other vectors will be linearly dependent
	- (d) TODO
	- (e) consider $d = 0$, DF and reconstruction formulas. Then devise the path planning.

- Problem 2: TODO

- Problem 3: TODO

# Textbook Exercises
- 11.1: RWD tricycle connected to N trailers with revolute joints
	- find a set of generalized coordinates
- 11.2: Omnidirectional Mecanum wheels robot and its Pfaffian constraints
	- prove that the constraints are partially integrable and that the orientation of the vehicle is a linear function of the wheel rotation angles
	- MATLAB code provided
- 11.3: Show the involutivity of the distribution $\Delta = span{g_1, â€¦, g_{n-1}}$ for a kinematic model with a single kinematic constraint
- 11.4: Prove that a set of Pfaffian constraints that doesn't depend on the generalized coordinates $q$ is always integrable and so is not controllable
	- the explanation is written in a textbox in the solutions pdf
- 11.5: given the a sequence of velocity input in interval $\epsilon$ for the unicycle KM, show that $\epsilon$ infinitesimal makes the displacement aligned with the Lie Bracked of the input VF
- 11.6: Prove the input transformation from the differential drive vehicle to the equivalent unicycle
- 11.7: For the bycicle
	- Determine the Instantaneous Centre of Rotation (ICR) cartesian position. RF centered in the rear wheel with x' aligned with the bicycle body
	- Find the angular velocity as a function of $q$ and RW center. It's the same as the one in the KM of the bicycle
	- Find the linaer velocity of a generic point P on the robot chassis
- 11.8: KM of the trycicle robot towing N trailers
- 11.9: Differential drive with bounds $|\omega_R(t)| \leq \omega_{RL}$ and $|\omega_L(t)| \leq \omega_{RL}$, that is a square of admissible region in the $\omega_R$, $\omega_L$ plane. Describe the corresponding constraint in the $v$, $\omega$ plane. 
	- It can be proven that it's a rhombus
	- You can find the maximum values for $v$ and $\omega$ given these bounds
- 12.1: Configuration space of a 6 DoF robot mounted on a unicycle
	- keep in mind that even in $\mathbb{R}^3$ a rotation in $SO(2)$ (see 2. Configuration Space)
- 12.2: Modify configuration space distance for a 2R manipulator so that the posture doesn't change if $q_1$ and $q_2$ are increased (or decreased) by a multiple of $2\pi$
	- the important thing for this new distance is that its value is the same (since it's posture is the same) if you sum or decrease a multiple of $2\pi$ from a coordinate. It's not needed that this new distance has the same values of the previous one (although it has the same values if the Euclidean distance between $q_1$ and $q_2$ is not larger than $sqrt(2)\pi$)
