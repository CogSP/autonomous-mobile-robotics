Resources for the Sapienza AMR course, held by Prof. Oriolo  

Note: the three suggested textbooks are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iVVsa5YCw1IODRD4ZuuUnNy4_YOhSOM-). I couldnâ€™t upload the files to GitHub because they are too large. Additionally, please note that the available textbooks are not the latest versions.
