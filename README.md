## Didactic Material

- Textbooks: the three suggested textbooks are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iVVsa5YCw1IODRD4ZuuUnNy4_YOhSOM-). I couldnâ€™t upload the files to GitHub because they are too large. Additionally, please note that the available textbooks are not the latest versions. All these books are available in the DIAG library.
